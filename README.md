Nepal Emergency Response: Disaster Monitoring and Analysis System.

This emergency response portal is an integrated Web GIS project highlighting historical and real-time earthquake data and showcases the danger zones due to flood. This interactive web dashboard helps emergency responders and analysts monitor natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Through integration with powerful open-source mapping libraries and geospatial tools, it allows customized surveillance, threat-level filtering, and effective visualization.



The portal integrates 3 basemaps: 

1. OSM basemap for viewer's adaptability

2. Satellite map for real physical interpretation  

3. Carto DB dark for contrast and feature distinction.



Seismic Analysis can be done temporally using USGS API to load earthquake data >4 Magnitude Richter Scale from the last 10 years up to real time data integration. The threat levels are labelled according to magnitude.



River data is loaded and Flood Zones can be predicted and analyzed using Buffer analysis ranging up to 1 kilometers.
